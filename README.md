# GraphQL Implementation using ReasonML

Note: The development of this project is halted as the performance improvement compared to the Reference JavaScript was negligible and maintainability was not improved either.

## How to develop locally

First NodeJS needs to be installed in the local machine. Instructions can be found in the official NodeJS website.

Once it's installed, clone this repository and run the following command in the root if the project:

```
npm install
```

Then, running the following command will compile the ReasonML code to JavaScript.

```
npm start
```

The compiled files can be found in `lib/js/src/`
